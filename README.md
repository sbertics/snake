July 13, 2011

I wrote this program during the summer quarter in 2011 to win the Stanford CS106A graphics contest.

File: Snake.java, SnakeSegment.java, SnakeFunctions.java, SnakeBegin.java
The basic snake game (snake moves around screen, eating food/ growing)
has been enhanced in this program to include:
 *   Five styles of gameplay
 *   Two sizes of snake
 * 	 Single and Multi-player modes
 * 	 Four power-ups
 * 	 Three types of food
 *   Animations
 *   png images
 * 	 and Photoshop Graphics
